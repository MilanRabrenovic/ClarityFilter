# ClarityFilter v4.0 - Major Security & Stability Update

## üöÄ **What's New in v4.0**

This major update brings significant security improvements, bug fixes, and enhanced stability across both Chrome and Mozilla versions of ClarityFilter.

## üîí **Security Enhancements**

### **1. Enhanced PIN Protection**
- **Upgraded to PBKDF2**: Replaced simple SHA-256 with PBKDF2 (150,000 iterations) for much stronger PIN hashing
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing SHA-256 PINs continue to work while new PINs use the stronger algorithm
- **Salt Consistency**: Standardized salt separator format across all components

### **2. Input Validation & Sanitization**
- **Import Security**: Added comprehensive validation for JSON imports with file size limits (1MB) and rate limiting (5-second cooldown)
- **ReDoS Protection**: Added regex complexity limits to prevent ReDoS attacks
- **Content Sanitization**: Enhanced input validation with length limits and HTML sanitization
- **Synthetic Event Protection**: Added `e.isTrusted` checks to prevent malicious keyboard event injection

### **3. Content Security Policy (CSP)**
- **Tightened CSP**: Removed `unsafe-inline` and moved inline styles to CSS classes
- **XSS Prevention**: Enhanced protection against cross-site scripting attacks

## üêõ **Bug Fixes**

### **1. Keyboard Shortcut Issues**
- **Chrome Manifest V3 Fix**: Resolved service worker lifecycle issues that prevented keyboard shortcuts from working
- **Race Condition Fix**: Eliminated stale-read issues between background and content scripts
- **Atomic Toggle**: Implemented atomic toggle operations to prevent double-flipping

### **2. PIN Management**
- **PIN Removal Bug**: Fixed issue where users couldn't remove PINs after setting them
- **PIN Verification**: Resolved inconsistencies in PIN verification across different components
- **Storage Consistency**: Fixed missing PIN algorithm and iteration fields in storage

### **3. Import/Export**
- **Format Flexibility**: Enhanced JSON import to handle additional fields (`mode`, `pixelCell`) gracefully
- **URL Validation**: Improved URL validation to accept domain-only entries (e.g., "reddit.com")
- **Error Handling**: Better error messages and validation feedback

## ‚ö° **Performance Improvements**

### **1. Service Worker Optimization**
- **Keep-Alive Strategy**: Implemented aggressive service worker keep-alive for Chrome Manifest V3
- **Reduced Quota Errors**: Added rate limiting to prevent `MAX_WRITE_OPERATIONS_PER_MINUTE` errors
- **Memory Management**: Improved memory usage and cleanup

### **2. Content Script Efficiency**
- **Reduced Redundancy**: Eliminated duplicate keyboard handlers and message processing
- **Optimized Scanning**: Improved DOM scanning performance with better node limits

## üé® **User Experience Improvements**

### **1. Enhanced Status Messages**
- **Visual Feedback**: Added color-coded status messages (green for success, red for errors, blue for info)
- **Better Design**: Improved styling with borders, shadows, and smooth transitions
- **Longer Display**: Increased message display time for better visibility

### **2. Improved Error Handling**
- **Graceful Degradation**: Better handling of missing content scripts and service worker issues
- **User-Friendly Messages**: Clearer error messages and validation feedback

## üîß **Technical Improvements**

### **1. Code Architecture**
- **Unified Toggle Flow**: Centralized toggle logic in background scripts for consistency
- **Message Handling**: Improved communication between background and content scripts
- **Error Recovery**: Better error handling and recovery mechanisms

### **2. Cross-Browser Compatibility**
- **Chrome Manifest V3**: Full support for Chrome's new manifest version
- **Mozilla Compatibility**: Maintained full compatibility with Mozilla extensions
- **Consistent Behavior**: Ensured identical functionality across both platforms

## üìã **Breaking Changes**

- **PIN Algorithm**: New PINs use PBKDF2 instead of SHA-256 (existing PINs continue to work)
- **CSP Policy**: Stricter Content Security Policy may affect custom styling
- **Import Format**: Enhanced validation may reject previously accepted malformed JSON files

## üõ†Ô∏è **Developer Notes**

### **Security Considerations**
- All user inputs are now validated and sanitized
- PIN hashing uses industry-standard PBKDF2 with high iteration count
- Content Security Policy prevents inline script execution

### **Performance Considerations**
- Service worker keep-alive may increase memory usage slightly
- Rate limiting prevents excessive storage operations
- Enhanced validation adds minimal processing overhead

## üîÑ **Migration Guide**

### **For Existing Users**
- **PINs**: Existing PINs continue to work; new PINs will use stronger encryption
- **Settings**: All existing settings are preserved and migrated automatically
- **Imports**: Enhanced validation may require re-exporting settings if previous imports were malformed

### **For Developers**
- **API Changes**: No breaking API changes for external integrations
- **Event Handling**: Keyboard event handling now includes `isTrusted` checks
- **Storage Format**: PIN storage format extended with algorithm and iteration fields

## üìä **Version Comparison**

| Feature | v3.x | v4.0 |
|---------|------|------|
| PIN Security | SHA-256 | PBKDF2 (150k iterations) |
| Import Validation | Basic | Comprehensive with limits |
| Keyboard Shortcuts | Inconsistent | Reliable across platforms |
| Service Worker | Basic | Aggressive keep-alive |
| Error Handling | Basic | Enhanced with visual feedback |
| CSP Policy | Permissive | Strict |

## üéØ **What's Next**
